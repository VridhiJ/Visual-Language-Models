# Visual-Language-Models

In this repository, I will include exploration of various papers with peers and my own interpretation.

   - For this paper: I've added my own interpretation in a concise presentation form. 
2. Janus Flow: Autoregressive model with rectified flow.
3. mPLUG-Owl 2: First MLLM model to exhibit the phenomena of modality collaboration in both pure-text and multi-modal contexts
