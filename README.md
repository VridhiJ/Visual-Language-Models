# Visual-Language-Models

In this repository, I will include exploration of various papers with peers and my own interpretation. 

1. Flamingo Model: A few shot learning model developed by Google DeepMind.
2. Janus Flow: Autoregressive model with rectified flow.
3. mPLUG-Owl 2: First MLLM model to exhibit the phenomena of modality collaboration in both pure-text and multi-modal contexts
